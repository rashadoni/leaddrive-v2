## 2026-09-26 — imported continuation point

- Active worktree: `/mnt/HC_Volume_106454338/codex-alt-data/worktrees/leaddrive-workforce-android-foundation-part3`.
- Active branch: `codex/workforce-android-foundation-v2-part3`.
- Repository and PR: `rashadoni/leaddrive-v2`, PR #198.
- Saved reviewed head was `e93f7b77e939900577f5dd41d78eb80271b2266a`, with the machine, Android and Social Monitoring checks green and no reported `agent-review` result.
- Owner approval for the unchanged visible PR #198 scope was already granted and must not be requested again.
- Production is only `13.140.132.245:/opt/leaddrive-v2`, reached through reviewed GitHub `main` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Full build, browser E2E, Android and load verification stay off Contabo and must be reported as `NOT RUN` unless completed by approved CI or a heavy worker.

## 2026-09-26 — independent-review reconciliation in progress

- All required project instructions were read in full: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DELIVERY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, the completion roadmap, the original HRM module plan and the reference session log.
- Routing was revalidated with `codex-project-context`: the requested worktree/branch/origin are correct; the release route is GitHub `main` to `deploy.yml` and the registered production path is `/opt/leaddrive-v2`.
- The branch had already advanced to merge-only head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e`, merging current `origin/main` into the saved head. `git range-diff` reports all 27 PR commits unchanged, and `git show --remerge-diff` reports no manual conflict resolution.
- PR #198 remains open and mergeable but blocked. Branch protection now requires `pr-scope`, `static-checks`, `typecheck`, `runner-policy`, `scan` and exact-SHA `agent-review`; the first four completed machine/Android checks observed so far are green, while `static-checks`, `typecheck` and independent review are still pending.
- A separate read-only agent is reviewing the owner-requested range `6d29020cdb9c695a374ba66a6bc795dd23edcb60..e93f7b77e939900577f5dd41d78eb80271b2266a` and the applicability of that result to merge-only head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e`.
- A pre-existing uncommitted delivery-control patch was found in this worktree. It restores the documented exact-SHA `agent-review` context and adds a stale-head-safe status publisher. It is being preserved and inspected; it is not part of PR #198 and cannot inherit that PR's review.
- Targeted local checks completed for the preserved delivery patch: `git diff --check`, both shell syntax checks and `node scripts/ci/test-event-platform-assets.mjs` pass. Heavy gates were not run locally by host policy.
- Precise stopping point: wait for the independent review and the two running required GitHub jobs; do not publish success or merge until all apply to the exact PR head.
- Next action: address any real review/check finding, publish exact-SHA `agent-review` only after a green independent result, merge PR #198, wait for deploy, and verify `/api/v1/ping` plus `artifactSha` against merged `main`.

## 2026-09-26 — current-main reopen-test integration repair

- Required `static-checks` on merge head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e` failed honestly: `workforce-workday-reopen.test.ts` and `workforce-workday-reopen-undo.test.ts`, added on current `main` after the saved PR head, still expected schema v4 and an older event shape.
- The production writers already use `WORKFORCE_WORKDAY_CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` and emit explicit null location/accuracy for server-created manager events. The two tests now assert that canonical version constant and the complete null proof shape instead of pinning stale schema v4.
- No baseline was updated and no check was weakened.
- `git diff --check` is available locally. The two focused Vitest files are `NOT RUN` locally because this worktree intentionally has no installed dependencies; an attempted cached-dependency execution could not resolve worktree ESM dependencies, and its generated cache was moved out of the worktree. Exact-SHA GitHub `static-checks` remains the authoritative rerun.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint and push the two-test integration repair plus this journal entry, then require a fresh exact-SHA machine gate and independent review.
- Next action: push without staging the preserved delivery-control patch, monitor replacement CI, and have the independent reviewer cover both the original PR range and the new integration delta.

## 2026-09-26 — independent-review security repair prepared

- Independent review returned RED on exact head `d3a2b5e35add34855bba0cd674ac5ca144c4475c`: unknown attestation enums could pass as hardware, Google decode ran under Prisma/workday locks, and README denied the implemented next-segment reminder.
- Attestation now uses explicit hardware-level allowlists plus runtime claim-shape checks. Play Integrity now decodes after read-only policy/device preflight but before either write transaction; the transaction rechecks policy, enrollment, attestation/signature, token fingerprint, exact-action hash and freshness before raw-free persistence. Decoder failure is data so a concurrent exact replay can still return before verification.
- README/C5 evidence match the implementation. No tenant policy, credential, capability or production state changed. The unrelated delivery-control patch remains unstaged.
- Local `git diff --check` passes. Focused Vitest/typecheck/full build/browser/Android/load are `NOT RUN` locally because the worktree has no dependencies and heavy gates belong to CI.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint only the reviewer-finding repair, push it, publish a new exact-SHA pending `agent-review`, then wait for machine CI and independent rereview of the complete delta.
- Next action: fix any CI/rereview finding without weakening gates; only a green exact head may merge and enter the documented `main` → `deploy.yml` release path.

## 2026-09-26 — exact-head typecheck repair

- Independent rereview of `a5c9c0ee7f2eb1c7c7b39b631c7f408eb646e236` is GREEN with zero findings. Android, `pr-scope`, `runner-policy`, `scan` and `static-checks` passed; exact-SHA `agent-review` was published only after that result.
- Required `typecheck` failed on two new TS2322 pairs: both routes passed the preflight helper's explicit `null` to an optional transaction input accepting `WorkforceAttendancePlayIntegrityPreflight | undefined`.
- Both boundaries now normalize `null` to `undefined`; no baseline or gate changed. Local typecheck remains `NOT RUN` because dependencies are absent and heavy verification belongs to CI.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint and push the two-line type-boundary repair without staging the preserved delivery-control patch.
- Next action: require fresh exact-SHA machine CI and independent rereview before merge.
