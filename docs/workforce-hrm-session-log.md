## 2026-09-26 — imported continuation point

- Active worktree: `/mnt/HC_Volume_106454338/codex-alt-data/worktrees/leaddrive-workforce-android-foundation-part3`.
- Active branch: `codex/workforce-android-foundation-v2-part3`.
- Repository and PR: `rashadoni/leaddrive-v2`, PR #198.
- Saved reviewed head was `e93f7b77e939900577f5dd41d78eb80271b2266a`, with the machine, Android and Social Monitoring checks green and no reported `agent-review` result.
- Owner approval for the unchanged visible PR #198 scope was already granted and must not be requested again.
- Production is only `13.140.132.245:/opt/leaddrive-v2`, reached through reviewed GitHub `main` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Full build, browser E2E, Android and load verification stay off Contabo and must be reported as `NOT RUN` unless completed by approved CI or a heavy worker.

## 2026-09-26 — independent-review reconciliation in progress

- All required project instructions were read in full: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DELIVERY-ARCHITECTURE.md`, the completion roadmap, the original HRM module plan and the reference session log.
- Routing was revalidated with `codex-project-context`: the requested worktree/branch/origin are correct; the release route is GitHub `main` to `deploy.yml` and the registered production path is `/opt/leaddrive-v2`.
- The branch had already advanced to merge-only head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e`, merging current `origin/main` into the saved head. `git range-diff` reports all 27 PR commits unchanged, and `git show --remerge-diff` reports no manual conflict resolution.
- PR #198 remains open and mergeable but blocked. Branch protection now requires `pr-scope`, `static-checks`, `typecheck`, `runner-policy`, `scan` and exact-SHA `agent-review`; the first four completed machine/Android checks observed so far are green, while `static-checks`, `typecheck` and independent review are still pending.
- A separate read-only agent is reviewing the owner-requested range `6d29020cdb9c695a374ba66a6bc795dd23edcb60..e93f7b77e939900577f5dd41d78eb80271b2266a` and the applicability of that result to merge-only head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e`.
- A pre-existing uncommitted delivery-control patch was found in this worktree. It restores the documented exact-SHA `agent-review` context and adds a stale-head-safe status publisher. It is being preserved and inspected; it is not part of PR #198 and cannot inherit that PR's review.
- Targeted local checks completed for the preserved delivery patch: `git diff --check`, both shell syntax checks and `node scripts/ci/test-event-platform-assets.mjs` pass. Heavy gates were not run locally by host policy.
- Precise stopping point: wait for the independent review and the two running required GitHub jobs; do not publish success or merge until all apply to the exact PR head.
- Next action: address any real review/check finding, publish exact-SHA `agent-review` only after a green independent result, merge PR #198, wait for deploy, and verify `/api/v1/ping` plus `artifactSha` against merged `main`.

## 2026-09-26 — current-main reopen-test integration repair

- Required `static-checks` on merge head `6a3ff41221f3069a6f06401f1c370e95e5e30a6e` failed honestly: `workforce-workday-reopen.test.ts` and `workforce-workday-reopen-undo.test.ts`, added on current `main` after the saved PR head, still expected schema v4 and an older event shape.
- The production writers already use `WORKFORCE_WORKDAY_CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` and emit explicit null location/accuracy for server-created manager events. The two tests now assert that canonical version constant and the complete null proof shape instead of pinning stale schema v4.
- No baseline was updated and no check was weakened.
- `git diff --check` is available locally. The two focused Vitest files are `NOT RUN` locally because this worktree intentionally has no installed dependencies; an attempted cached-dependency execution could not resolve worktree ESM dependencies, and its generated cache was moved out of the worktree. Exact-SHA GitHub `static-checks` remains the authoritative rerun.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint and push the two-test integration repair plus this journal entry, then require a fresh exact-SHA machine gate and independent review.
- Next action: push without staging the preserved delivery-control patch, monitor replacement CI, and have the independent reviewer cover both the original PR range and the new integration delta.

## 2026-09-26 — independent-review security repair prepared

- Independent review returned RED on exact head `d3a2b5e35add34855bba0cd674ac5ca144c4475c`: unknown attestation enums could pass as hardware, Google decode ran under Prisma/workday locks, and README denied the implemented next-segment reminder.
- Attestation now uses explicit hardware-level allowlists plus runtime claim-shape checks. Play Integrity now decodes after read-only policy/device preflight but before either write transaction; the transaction rechecks policy, enrollment, attestation/signature, token fingerprint, exact-action hash and freshness before raw-free persistence. Decoder failure is data so a concurrent exact replay can still return before verification.
- README/C5 evidence match the implementation. No tenant policy, credential, capability or production state changed. The unrelated delivery-control patch remains unstaged.
- Local `git diff --check` passes. Focused Vitest/typecheck/full build/browser/Android/load are `NOT RUN` locally because the worktree has no dependencies and heavy gates belong to CI.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint only the reviewer-finding repair, push it, publish a new exact-SHA pending `agent-review`, then wait for machine CI and independent rereview of the complete delta.
- Next action: fix any CI/rereview finding without weakening gates; only a green exact head may merge and enter the documented `main` → `deploy.yml` release path.

## 2026-09-26 — exact-head typecheck repair

- Independent rereview of `a5c9c0ee7f2eb1c7c7b39b631c7f408eb646e236` is GREEN with zero findings. Android, `pr-scope`, `runner-policy`, `scan` and `static-checks` passed; exact-SHA `agent-review` was published only after that result.
- Required `typecheck` failed on two new TS2322 pairs: both routes passed the preflight helper's explicit `null` to an optional transaction input accepting `WorkforceAttendancePlayIntegrityPreflight | undefined`.
- Both boundaries now normalize `null` to `undefined`; no baseline or gate changed. Local typecheck remains `NOT RUN` because dependencies are absent and heavy verification belongs to CI.
- Precise stopping point: checkpoint and push the two-line type-boundary repair without staging the preserved delivery-control patch.
- Next action: require fresh exact-SHA machine CI and independent rereview before merge.

## 2026-09-26 — PR #198 merged and production verified

- Final PR head `81ca9a130862b13d50223e66d4de4f81a64b3dcf` passed `pr-scope`, `static-checks`, `typecheck`, `runner-policy`, `scan`, Android debug lint/unit and an exact-SHA independent rereview with zero findings. No admin bypass was used.
- PR #198 merged normally as `cb9a886ab888b28e8098a735dfac3ff93875d4d5`. GitHub deploy run `36250578124` passed quality/security, built and uploaded the immutable SHA-bound artifact, deployed atomically to the registered production target and passed its post-deploy smoke.
- Independent public verification returned HTTP 200 with `{"ok":true}` from `/api/v1/ping`; `/api/v1/public/build-info` returned HTTP 200 with `artifactSha=cb9a886ab888b28e8098a735dfac3ff93875d4d5`.
- Progress remains honestly `81/161`, `14/15`, C5 81% and C9 99%. Physical Android/QR/GPS/biometric, isolated load/restore and human pilot evidence remain `NOT RUN`; no 100% claim is made.
- Work continues in the same worktree on new branch `codex/workforce-agent-review-gate`, based exactly on the deployed merge SHA. Live protection currently preserves five GitHub Actions checks with `app_id=15368`, `enforce_admins=true`, a non-null zero-approval PR-only rule and force-push/deletion disabled, but lacks required `agent-review`.
- Precise stopping point: the PR #198 release is complete; the preserved delivery-control patch is still uncommitted and must not be applied in its unsafe legacy form.
- Next action: create a separate reviewed delivery-control PR that adds exact-SHA `agent-review` without weakening admin enforcement, PR-only protection or app bindings, then verify the live readback after merge.

## 2026-09-26 — exact-SHA review gate prepared without changing live protection

- Read-only REST inspection established the exact live baseline: `strict=false`; five required GitHub Actions contexts with `app_id=15368`; `enforce_admins=true`; a non-null PR-only rule with zero required approvals; force pushes and deletion disabled. `agent-review` alone was absent, so the process gate remained `14/15` despite PR #198's independently reviewed release.
- The isolated delivery-control patch now uses the `checks` API instead of legacy `contexts`, preserves all five Actions app bindings, adds `agent-review` with the documented any-app binding, keeps admin/PR/force-push/deletion safeguards, and fails if the post-write REST readback differs from the six-context contract.
- The new status publisher accepts only a full lowercase 40-character SHA, re-reads one open PR targeting `main`, requires an exact current-head match and refuses an API failure or incomplete response before posting. Behavioral coverage rejects an abbreviated SHA, invalid state, API failure, missing data, stale head, wrong base and closed PR, then proves exact-head `pending` and `success` publication.
- Targeted local evidence: both shell syntax checks PASS; `node scripts/ci/test-publish-agent-review-status.mjs` PASS; `node scripts/ci/test-event-platform-assets.mjs` PASS (`27` domains, `86` topics, `5` concrete schemas); `git diff --check` PASS. Full build, broad typecheck, browser E2E, Android and load tests are `NOT RUN` because this is a delivery-script/docs slice and heavy checks belong to CI/approved workers.
- Live branch protection has deliberately not been mutated. Progress remains `81/161`, `14/15`, C5 81% and C9 99%; no product or gate credit is claimed before reviewed merge and exact live readback.
- Precise stopping point: local fail-closed implementation and targeted evidence are ready; independent read-only pre-commit review of the current diff is running.
- Next action: resolve every real review finding, checkpoint only task-owned paths, push a sub-400 KB PR and require exact-head independent review plus all machine checks before normal merge; apply and verify the configurator only from reviewed `main`.

## 2026-09-26 — delivery-control pre-commit review GREEN

- Independent review found one real P2: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/DELIVERY-ARCHITECTURE.md` and the delivery asset assertion still justified the removed production environment reviewer with a stale private-repository/Enterprise limitation even though `rashadoni/leaddrive-v2` is public.
- The three locations now state the actual boundary: this solo-owner repository has no separately governed human identity that can approve a deployment while self-review is prevented. Independent review is enforced before merge by the exact-SHA `agent-review`; the production environment remains restricted to `main`.
- Fresh rereview of the complete shared working tree returned GREEN with zero remaining findings. It confirmed the exact six contexts and app bindings, admin/PR/force-push/deletion invariants, positive and negative configurator mock-readback, fail-closed publisher cases and a complete diff size of `55,180` bytes.
- GitHub's supported-version documentation confirms the pinned REST version `2022-11-28` remains supported through 2028-03-10, so no opportunistic API migration is included in this safety slice.
- Precise stopping point: local implementation, targeted evidence and independent pre-commit review are green; live protection remains unchanged.
- Next action: create the checkpoint commit, push the isolated branch, open a draft PR, publish `agent-review=pending` for its exact head and require fresh exact-head review plus all machine checks before normal merge.
