# WF-C8-007f — generation-bound moved-day reversal evidence


## 2026-09-30 — WF-C8-007f implementation checkpoint on part14

- Successor created in the same dedicated worktree from verified main
  `77a5c48080e4297c666bde00112fbba2fc071636`; branch
  `codex/workforce-completion-part14`. Four append-only receipt checkpoints
  carried forward; canonical checkout and unrelated worktrees untouched.
- Added strict ORGANIZATION/TEAM `REVERSE_MOVE_WORKDAY` POST. Inventory exposes
  an opaque SHA-256 generation bound to both physical row IDs, tenant, scope
  and reciprocal dates, only for complete writer-owned future ADMIN pairs.
  Whole-pair and one-half replacement invalidate the old generation.
- Transaction uses sorted dual date advisory locks, a bounded short calendar
  table SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE lock, TEAM FOR SHARE, explicit ReadCommitted and
  5s lock / 10s transaction bounds. The table lock also stabilizes absent
  organization parents against legacy writers without advisory cooperation.
  It serializes calendar writes briefly across tenants; no external IO occurs
  under locks. Exact full-row CAS soft-deletes both originals with one common
  timestamp/actor, then one audit receipt; any second-CAS/audit failure rolls
  the first change back. No schema or existing writer changes.
- TEAM reversal rejects a revealed Route baseline that differs from either
  frozen pair row. Route mutation, AGENT moves, general update/delete and
  break policy remain excluded. Legacy/malformed pairs fail closed.
- Versioned strict old/new audit receipts bind full original snapshots, both
  IDs, tenant/scope/dates/generation and original reversal actor. Replay checks
  only those original rows and exact tombstone/provenance snapshots; missing,
  duplicate or altered receipts are rejected. A later authorized actor may
  acknowledge a completed reversal after dates pass or TEAM becomes inactive;
  current replacements are neither read as the replay target nor changed.
- Existing calendar sections retained. Source-only inline confirmation reviews
  scope and both dates. A synchronous shared mutation token blocks same-tick
  double submit; tenant/principal/target fences discard obsolete responses.
  Unknown transport/commit outcomes retain the exact generation-bound retry.
  RU/EN/AZ copy and existing voice guide updated without generated narration.
- Current-tree bounded Vitest: 11 files / 148 tests PASS in 8.48s; real-PG file
  12 tests SKIPPED locally because DB URL was explicitly removed. Scoped ESLint,
  i18n parity (23,918 keys; RU/AZ missing=0 extra=0) and diff whitespace PASS.
- Real PostgreSQL proof suite now contains 12 cases (2 retained + 10 new):
  actual lock waits, concurrent reversal, second-CAS and audit-insert rollback,
  whole/half replacement ABA, missing receipt, changed/inserting parent Route
  state and restricted UPDATE-privileged tenant-RLS role. Tests use real SQL,
  deterministic bounded barriers, pg_stat_activity/pg_locks wait evidence and
  full persisted-state comparisons. Required existing static-checks CI runs
  this file with PostgreSQL16; no CI/baseline/protection changes.
- Real PG, full typecheck, production build, full suite, browser/AT/device,
  Android/load/chaos: NOT RUN locally under Contabo placement contract. CI,
  independent exact-head review, publication, required gates and release are
  pending; implementation is not yet production evidence.
- Progress remains DONE81/161, GATES14/15, C8 36%, overall59%, 80 non-DONE.
  WF-C8-007 remains PARTIAL; broader calendar editing is outside this slice.
- Current result: bounded007f source and proofs implemented, local targeted
  checks GREEN. Last action: tests/lint/translations. Precise stopping point:
  implementation checkpoint before independent exact-head review. Next action:
  review, fix any findings, publish successor PR and run protected CI/release.

## 2026-09-30 — #511 real PostgreSQL and static gate receipts

- Primary static-checks job109997700289 of PR run36747573309 SUCCESS,
  completed2026-09-30T17:06:59Z. Exact PR head3b827425; CI checked synthetic
  merge3d9ec36 into unchanged main77a5c480. No other source candidate credited.
- Real calendar PostgreSQL12/12 PASS, no skips,2060ms; full Workforce
  shared-lock gate3files/33tests PASS11.80s. This supersedes local NOT RUN only
  for these CI SQL cases; local host still did not run PostgreSQL tests.
- Real concurrency, first-CAS and both-CAS/audit rollback, whole/half ABA,
  original receipt replay, noncooperating parent Route writers and restricted
  UPDATE-only/NOBYPASSRLS tenant behavior now have executed CI evidence.
- Blocking full unit baseline18failing files/18accepted: no new failures and
  every baseline entry still fails (no stale entries). Existing baseline was
  not edited. Event-platform assets/migrations/concurrency, Demo DB constraints,
  legacy-client rollback and PII guard also succeeded in this static job.
- Independent read-only primary-job-log verification agrees; transient receipt
  /tmp/workforce-511-static-109997700289.log. Typecheck remains pending and is
  not implied by this static receipt. Next action: blocking TypeScript results,
  fresh-main check, protected merge and deploy/public SHA proof.


## 2026-09-30 — #511 blocking TypeScript failure corrected; new exact head required

- Initial run36747573309 typecheck109997700539 FAIL on one new gated TS2345
  in calendar-configuration.ts partnerDates.map(asDatabaseDate). Syntax/missing
  module/undefined-name gate passed, but defect baseline correctly blocked:
  67gated pairs vs66accepted,1201advisory diagnostics. No merge occurred.
- Root cause: global Prisma export is untyped; input.db ?? prisma lost the
  generated client types, allowing the new Set/date list to infer unknown[].
  Added explicit PrismaClient annotations only to the inventory and reversal
  DB variables. The new transaction now checks selected fields/audit/CAS with
  generated types as well. No runtime behavior or baseline/workflow changes.
- Before bounded checks: RAM16.8GBavailable,disk342GB,memorypressure0.
  Three affected domain/API files72tests PASS2.65s; scoped service ESLint and
  whitespace PASS. Full typecheck remains NOT RUN locally; new exact-head
  review and all required CI contexts must pass for the replacement candidate.
- Earlier review/SQL/static receipts remain valid only at their recorded3b
  source HEAD. They do not substitute for new-head CI/review. Current result:
  type inference fix implemented and locally checked. Last action: diagnosis
  and annotation fix. Precise stopping point: replacement checkpoint/publish.
  Next action: independent complete exact-head review and protected CI rerun.
