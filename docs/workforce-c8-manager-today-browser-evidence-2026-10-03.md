# WF-C8-002 — real hosted Manager Today browser acceptance

## Boundaries

The bounded runtime released in PR491 remains unchanged. This slice adds an
isolated hosted PostgreSQL16/Chromium evidence lane for `/workforce` and the
actual `GET /api/v1/workforce/today`. The current calendar twelve-case and
thirty-six-observation contrast lane stays unchanged.

The synthetic fixture will contain twenty-six ordered active employees in
one granted team, with foreign-tenant, inactive and out-of-scope sentinels.
Real credentials/session authentication, forced tenant RLS, actual response
headers and DOM assertions must prove the scheduled employee without a
workday remains visible and explained. Separate rows cover persisted
NO_SHOW, previous-open workday, approved leave, holiday and unavailable
schedule. Only the manager with exception authority may see persisted
exceptions; attendance-only authority must receive `exceptions: null`.

Actual first-page25 and cursor-page1 responses must become twenty-six
ordered unique visible people through native Tab and Enter on Load More.
RU/AZ/EN screenshots provide current phone/tablet/desktop observations.
They do not prove native zoom, whole-page keyboard operation or human AT.
No-grant access must return403 without employee facts. Forged tenant headers
are stripped by the existing proxy; the proof must show the real session
remains bound to its tenant rather than assume an unsupported403 contract.

Only a disposable hosted database and loopback application are permitted.
The nonowner application role has SELECT and the three login metadata
column updates required by real authentication; Workforce facts are
read-only. Exact before/after count/hash snapshots exclude legitimate user
login metadata. Production-equivalent fixture checks/triggers are a bounded
subset, with omissions explicitly listed in its SQL header; this is not a
full migration or snapshot-write acceptance lane.

## 2026-10-03 — successor and preserved release evidence

PR546 normal release is verified at merged main
`839a3cbcdc321d8cc3a2091762449ec5d31de6f5`, own deploy37135406406 WHOLE SUCCESS
and independent strict public build→ping→build with exact artifactSha.
Append-only release evidence remains in the calendar evidence, roadmap and
session journal; all failures and later successful receipts retain their
original lineage.

Successor `codex/workforce-completion-part21` starts from fresh main839.
The five private receipt commits were normally cherry-picked. Its initial
`e98f42b4e658caca76380ef8324b063a9158f5ca` tree exactly equals the private
receipt branch tree `1ebc16568beb3f83f273ac0b478e8b18e93534cc`. No product
files differ from main at this checkpoint. Actual raw/preserved release
receipt Gitleaks8.30.1 scan with unchanged configuration:1,829,998bytes,
450ms, zero findings. `git diff --check` PASS. The original next-actionable
reconnaissance plan is preserved losslessly with its raw size/hash manifest.

The new hosted workflow, harness and SQL are being completed. Hosted browser
and PostgreSQL acceptance are **NOT RUN**. Targeted checks follow actual
installation; no source or acceptance GREEN is claimed for prepared files.
Preserve first actual failure before fixing a collector, fixture or product
defect, then require current exact-source review, current hosted acceptance,
all five mandatory PR gates, fresh-main normal merge and own deploy proof.

WF-C8-002 remains PARTIAL. DONE81/161, GATES14/15, C8 36%, overall59%,
80non-DONE. Human AT/native zoom/whole-page keyboard, authenticated
production Manager Today, Android/physical/load/pilot and heavy local
build/typecheck/full suite/browser/PostgreSQL are NOT RUN. No production
feature/grant activation, general update/delete, break policy, AGENT moves
or Route mutation.
